About This Project:

This project is a downloadable fighting game that learns from your play style and changes its strategy to challenge you as you play. Developed for the Fall 2025 PSU Hackathon by Aryan Sabnekar, Suraj Prem Chandran, Leona Chen, and Ayden Alex, it combines classic fighting game mechanics with machine learning to create an ever-evolving AI opponent.

How It Works:
As you play, the game logs your behaviorâ€”tracking movement, attacks, and overall strategy. This data trains an AI model (using a decision tree classifier) that adapts its tactics over time, learning how to counter your unique play style.

Data-Driven Insights:
We have included visualization tools help you see heatmaps of player positions and analyze the frequency of your key presses. This offers a glimpse into your gaming habits and what the AI is using to beat you.

Technologies Used:
Python for the core game logic and machine learning integration.
pygame for game development and rendering.
OpenCV for image processing.
scikit-learn for the adaptive AI model.
pandas and matplotlib for data analysis and visualization.

Feel free to explore the repository, try out the game, and see how the AI adapts to beat your playstyle. 

Contributions, feedback, and suggestions are welcome!
